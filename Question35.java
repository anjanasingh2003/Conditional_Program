/*. In a company, worker efficiency is determined on the basis of the time required for a
worker to complete a particular job. If the time taken by the worker is between 2 â€“ 3
hours, then the worker is said to be highly efficient. If the time required by the worker is
between 3 â€“ 4 hours, then the worker is ordered to improve speed. If the time taken is
between 4 â€“ 5 hours, the worker is given training to improve his speed, and if the time
taken by the worker is more than 5 hours, then the worker has to leave the company. If the
time taken by the worker is input through the keyboard, find the efficiency of the worker*/
